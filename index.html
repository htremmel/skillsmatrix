                <blockquote><p>“You live as if you were destined to live forever, no thought of your frailty ever enters your head, of how much time has already gone by you take no heed. You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last.”</p><footer>~ Seneca</footer></blockquote>
                <p>Herein lies my competency matrix, or what I want to master in my lifetime.  This provides a method to measure my progress, competency, and goal setting for my life.  My reasoning of making such a list is to always keep in focus why my pursuits are relevant.</p>
